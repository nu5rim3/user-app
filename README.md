## Simple Application
> This is simple web application that users register and update profile.

### Technologies
I have used ***MERN stack*** for create almost all of the functionalities of this application.
To create frontend I use ***React JS*** and for backend I used ***Node JS*** with ***Express***.
To store data I used ***MongoDB***
### File structure 
> When I create this application I created seperate folders for implement the frontend and the backend.
> In the backend folder I created seperate folders for routes, database models and the middleware. And also I create **.env**
> file to store the database connection link. But I did not include it to this repository because of the security.

> In the forntend I created seperate folder to contain the React components. And in the frontend also I created **.env**

#### Clone the applicaiton
```
git clone https://github.com/nu5rim3/user-app
```
#### Run the Application
Navigate to the backend folder. And then run
```
npm install
```
Do same for frontend folder. This will inatall all the dependency packages into the project.
Then navigate to the backend folder and run
```
npm run dev
```
And the application will run on the port 3000 in your browser.
